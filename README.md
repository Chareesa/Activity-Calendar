#Involve

A Project for Code Fellows by Jacob Shafer, Chareesa Graham, Stephanie Lingwood, Sheyna Watkins and Henok Kidane

###Background:
A lot of people are often uninformed about politics. Especially local politics: the decisions that affect them most.

###Objective/Goal:
We want to provide people an easy way to aggregate information about political matters and to share that information with friends.

###Personas:
* 30-somethings
* homeowners
* parents whose children are in local schools

All people have stake in political matters but we have chosen to start focusing on these groups because we believe that people who are homeowners and/or parents of school children have a new awareness of their stake in their community. They would also be more open to seeking this information on their phones.

###MVP GOALS
We know we cannot reach the nation from the get-go so we are starting with just one region: Seattle. We have added meeting and event information from the Seattle City Council and we can expand to include more agencies and more cities. We want to make the app the best it can be for one region before we progress to other cities.

**MVP Features**
* Calendar that aggregates meeting information
* Ability to email a friend meeting information
* Ability to log-in to an account

**Possible Future Features**
* More feeds from different groups/agencies etc ...
* More cities/regions
* A search function
* Ability to lookup elected officials
* More sophisticated indexing to finding local leaders and agencies based on user's zip code.
